description: Dashboard (React + Vite + TanStack Router + Tailwind 4) rules.

## Tech & structure
- React 19 + Vite 6, TanStack Router v1, Tailwind v4.
- Routes live under `src/routes/*` with file-based routing.
- Auth via `AuthContext`; the router context must include `{ auth }` (see `src/main.tsx`).
- Protect private routes with `beforeLoad` + `redirect` (e.g., `/dashboard`).

## Conventions
- Use `@repo/ui` for shared components; add new shared UI to `packages/ui`.
- Co-locate component styles; Tailwind class order is auto-sorted by Prettier plugin.
- Fetching: `@tanstack/react-query` preferred; colocate queries with screens.

## Adding a page/route
1. Create a file route under `src/routes/...`.
2. If protected, add a `beforeLoad` guard using `context.auth`.
4. Keep side effects in hooks; keep components presentational where possible.
